The Holy Grail of CB Apps


What is the Holy Grail of CB Apps?
==================================

To better explain that, I need to start with what, IMHO, CB apps are . . . and
aren't . . .

What CB Apps ARE:
=================

First, obviously apps are fun and often times useful little programs designed to
make a broadcaster's and member's experiences in a room a bit more enjoyable. Some
examples include apps that implement some sort of game, perform mundane tasks
like keeping a running total of tips, etc.

Most current apps fall into 1 of 4 categories (often with crossover between categories):

1.  Counting Apps - Keep a count of tips until some predefined goal(s) are met.  Good
    examples: Tip Goal, Rinse N Repeat
2.  Guess A Number Game - Member pays  to either guess directly, or have a random number
    selected for him/her in order to win predetermined prize.  Most all current games are
    some variation on this.  Examples: Token Keno, Wheel of Fortune, various raffles.
3.  Ego Strokes - Based on some condition (usually being the highest tipper), some
    additional status or perks are awarded to a member -- such as a special appearance
    for their chat text, or a title (like "TipKing").  Often combined with counting
    apps.  Example: TipKing
4.  Miscellaneous/Utility - usually not directly token related, but rather handles some
    mundane tasks like spam filtering, auto moderating, etc.  Often (not always)
    bots fall into this category.


What [the current apps] AREN'T:
===============================

Moneymakers!!!

Yes, I said it. Apps don't make money, broadcasters make money. It's my
contention that if a member is in a room, it's the broadcaster - thru appearance,
personality, charm, actions, whatever -- that is going to persuade a given member to
spend tokens. Apps don't change that. If a member is in the room, has (or intends to
buy) tokens, and has the desire to spend them on a broadcaster, he/she WILL -- regardless
of whether an app is running or not.  OK, I'll admit there are some marginal corner
cases where an app might persuade a member who is on-the-fence about tipping to part
with a few tokens - but those are the rare exceptions, not the rule.

Good example:  An average looking female broadcaster wants, let's say, 200 tokens for a
topless show.  She gets a few tips, maybe 40 tokens.  "Maybe an app would help", she
thinks.  So next time she starts the "Tip Sequence" app (members tip 1 then 2 then 3
etc. until a target # is reached) with a range of 1-20 (for a gross of 210 tokens when
complete).  Well guess what?  Her tipping stalls out around number 8 (36 tokens gross).
Why? The app didn't change the number of people in the room, the amount of tokens they
had, or their desire to tip her! If I hadn't slept thru half of Econ 101 I might call
this "Demand".  I think I will anyway! ;)


So, What Is the Holy Grail of Apps (HGA)?
=========================================

It hasn't been discovered yet so nobody is certain what it looks like.  But here's how
I'm envisioning it (Note: I'm referring to it as an "app" although in reality it's probably
going to be more like a category of apps, and I'm assuming it will be in the form of a game):

1.  It needs it's own Demand.  Members have to WANT to play the game.  This gets tricky
    balancing Demand for the HGA against Demand for the broadcaster (not much I can do
    about that)-- after all, CB's core business is webcams, not gaming - and it needs
    to STAY that way.
2.  It has to be simple to understand. (Programmers know what I mean when I say "develop
    for your dumbest user ever")
3.  Skill should be a factor, but not the only factor -- pure skill games will quickly
    get mastered by members and abused, so there has to be either some randomness or a
    very sharply rising skill curve.  Also bear in mind the first rule of game design:
    "If you create a game that requires skill, only people with skill will play it"
    This doesn't mean that people can't/won't develop skill though ;)
4.  Create cooperative goals if possible. Teamwork - subtle peer pressure - blah blah blah
5.  Fun
6.  Rewarding


Why Search For The HGA?
=======================

We all have friends who are broadcasters and I think we all want to see them do as well as
they possibly can. And the people working at CB as well.  Plus . . . whoever discovers the
HGA is going to become FILTHY RICH . . . ;-)

Yes, it's long shot . . . strip away all the verbiage and what we're really looking for here
is "a way to persuade people to pay for online content" . . . our odds may be on a par with
winning a $500mil Powerball lottery . . . but given the "specialized" nature of CB's core
business, I think in this case it may be possible (not easy, but possible).
